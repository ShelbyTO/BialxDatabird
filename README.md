Problematic:

Before a tenant moves out, the landlord conducts a pre-inspection (which precedes the final move-out inspection) to estimate the cost of any necessary repairs. These inspections are costly and can even be unnecessary if the sector manager finds no defects requiring the property's refurbishment.

Regarding the move-out inspection, tenants can be charged if the expert determines that the tenant has damaged the property or its equipment.

The first objective is to identify the properties that most need a pre-inspection to prioritize them for assessment. This would allow for early planning of any necessary repairs with contractors, thus reducing the vacancy period caused by these repairs.

The second objective is to determine if there is a specific tenant profile that has a high probability of causing damage, necessitating a move-out inspection.

Topic A: Target the properties where a pre-inspection is necessary.
Topic B: Identify a high-risk tenant profile to determine if a move-out inspection is necessary.
